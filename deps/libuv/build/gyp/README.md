GYP can Generate Your Projects
==============================

GYP was a build system originally developed for [Chromium](https://chromium.googlesource.com/external/gyp)
and still in use as the build system for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

This is a stripped-down version of [Node's lightly maintained copy of GYP](https://github.com/nodejs/node/tree/master/tools/gyp).
Its purpose is to test [libuv's](https://libuv.org/) GYP build but it might be
useful for other projects still stuck on GYP, too.
