// This header contains macros and defines used across the entire Wren
// implementation. In particular, it contains "configuration" defines that
// control how Wren works. Some of these are only used while hacking on
// debugging Wren itself.
//
// This header is *not* intended to be included by code outside of Wren itself.

// These flags let you control some details of the interpreter's implementation.
// Usually they trade-off a bit of portability for speed. They default to the
// most efficient behavior.

// If true, then Wren will use a NaN-tagged double for its core value
// representation. Otherwise, it will use a larger more conventional struct.
// The former is significantly faster and more compact. The latter is useful for
// debugging and may be more portable.
//
// Defaults to on.

// If true, the VM's interpreter loop uses computed gotos. See this for more:
// http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-3.1.1/gcc/Labels-as-Values.html
// Enabling this speeds up the main dispatch loop a bit, but requires compiler
// support.
//
// Defaults to on.

// The maximum number of globals that may be defined at one time. This
// limitation comes from the 16 bits used for the arguments to
// `CODE_LOAD_GLOBAL` and `CODE_STORE_GLOBAL`.
#define MAX_GLOBALS 65536

// The maximum number of arguments that can be passed to a method. Note that
// this limitation is hardcoded in other places in the VM, in particular, the
// `CODE_CALL_XX` instructions assume a certain maximum number.
#define MAX_PARAMETERS 16

// The maximum name of a method, not including the signature. This is an
// arbitrary but enforced maximum just so we know how long the method name
// strings need to be in the parser.
#define MAX_METHOD_NAME 64

// The maximum length of a method signature. This includes the name, and the
// extra spaces added to handle arity, and another byte to terminate the string.
#define MAX_METHOD_SIGNATURE (MAX_METHOD_NAME + MAX_PARAMETERS + 1)

// The maximum length of an identifier. The only real reason for this limitation
// is so that error messages mentioning variables can be stack allocated.
#define MAX_VARIABLE_NAME 64

// The maximum number of fields a class can have, including inherited fields.
// This is explicit in the bytecode since `CODE_CLASS` and `CODE_SUBCLASS` take
// a single byte for the number of fields. Note that it's 255 and not 256
// because creating a class takes the *number* of fields, not the *highest
// field index*.

// Assertions are used to validate program invariants. They indicate things the

// assertion fails, there is a bug in Wren.
